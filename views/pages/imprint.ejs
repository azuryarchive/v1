        <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
        <p>
          As a service provider, we are responsible for our content on these pages by § 7 paragraph 1 TMG according to general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not
          responsive to monitor transmitted or stored information from third parties or to investigate circumstances
          that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information by general
          laws remain unaffected by this. However, any liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
          knowledge of a concrete violation of the law. If we become aware of corresponding breaches, we will remove this content immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no impact.
          Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The contents of the
          linked pages are always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the pages. The linked
          pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
          were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a permanent control of the contents of linked pages without concrete evidence of an
          infringement is not reasonable. If we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will remove such links immediately.
        </p>

          respected. In particular contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you still become aware of any copyright infringement, we ask you to notify us accordingly. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
